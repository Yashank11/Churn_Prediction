This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a comprehensive machine learning pipeline applied to the Customer Churn Prediction 2020 dataset. The dataset was explored and analyzed using the YData Profiling tool, which provided a detailed overview of its characteristics. A series of preprocessing steps were applied, including encoding categorical variables with a TargetEncoder, selecting the best features with SelectKBest, transforming features with PowerTransformer, and handling class imbalance using SMOTE. The final model, a Gradient Boosting Classifier, was fine-tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters such as the number of selected features, the number of SMOTE neighbors, and the classifier's subsample and max depth. The optimized model achieved a balanced accuracy of 85.37% through 10-fold cross-validation. This robust pipeline was then applied to the test dataset to generate predictions, demonstrating an effective approach to addressing customer churn prediction.
